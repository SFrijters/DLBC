{"name":"DLBC","tagline":"Parallel D implementation of the Lattice Boltzmann method","body":"D Lattice Boltzmann Code\r\n===\r\n\r\nThis is a home project to implement the lattice Boltzmann method using the D programming language. The goal is to prove the suitability of the D programming language for scientific computing / HPC. Parallelization has been implemented through the use of MPI, and parallel I/O is handled through HDF5.\r\n\r\nD HDF5 bindings have been added as a submodule [hdf5-d](http://github.com/SFrijters/hdf5-d), while D MPI bindings are still a work in progress and are currently handled through a partial header translation.\r\n\r\nMultidimensional arrays have been added using Denis Shelomovskij's [Unstandard library](https://bitbucket.org/denis-sh/unstandard).\r\n\r\nDocumentation is generated using DDoc and Jakob Ovrum's [bootDoc](http://github.com/JakobOvrum/bootDoc).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe simulation code is made available under the [GPL-3.0 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt).
