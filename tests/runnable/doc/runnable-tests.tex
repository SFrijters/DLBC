\section{Runnable tests}

DLBC aims to have an extensive suite of runnable tests. When executed, the output of the test will be compared to a reference dataset.

\subsection{The Python script}

To aid in managing tests, the script \textsc{./tests/runnable/run-tests.py} has been created. It is always assumed that the script is called from its own location.

Currently the script handles the following options:

\input{generated/run-tests.tex}

\subsection{List of tests}

\input{generated/list-of-tests.tex}
